    <h2>
      <a name="v4.5">4.5</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This is the first release of Program D in three years. During this time, Program D has
      remained the most widely used open source / free AIML interpreter in the world. It has been
      employed in numerous projects, from personal-sized art projects to large, enterprise level
      deployments. The stability and consistent performance achieved in version 4.1.5 have proven
      enduring and reliable, despite the hiatus in available support.</p>
    <p>This new release focuses on updating the Program D technology to take advantage of progress
      in technologies available as part of the core Java platform. Core functionalities such as XML
      parsing, logging, and various architectural matters are now handled in a fashion that
      heightens stability, performance and maintainability.</p>
    <p>We have finally addressed the issue of component orientation: Program D can now be easily
      included into any application framework as a simple "core" object, without ever involving any
      undesired interfaces (servlet container, IM interface, etc.). On the other hand, these
      optional interfaces now use a more flexible and better defined API to connect to the Core, and
      we are confident that additional interfaces may now be provided with far more ease than
      before.</p>
    <p>Every line of code of Program D has been reviewed, and "refactored" as appropriate. The
      program still passes all of the AIML 1.0.1 test cases published with the previous version, as
      well as a few more.</p>

        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.component-orientation">Component Orientation</a>
        </h4>
        <p>The architecture of Program D has been thoroughly re-worked to make a clean separation
          between the "core" parts of the program&mdash;those which load AIML, parse inputs, and
          produce a response&mdash;and other parts, such as IM interfaces, web server
          interfaces, and so on. It is possible to instantiate the Program D Core object and
          configure it entirely programmatically, without manipulating any configuration files, if
          that is required.</p>
        <p>In the simplest form, using Program D from another program looks like:</p>
        <pre class="code">
Core core = new Core();
core.setup();
core.start();
String response = core.processResponse("hello");</pre>
        <p>The Core can be (and usually is) initialized with a properties file. The additional <span
            class="literal">setup()</span> step is separated out so that, for instance, consoles can
          be connected to the Core before proceeding with initialization. Following <span
            class="literal">setup()</span>, there is again the opportunity to do any further setup
          of other components before calling <span class="literal">start()</span> on the Core. The
            <span class="literal">getResponse()</span> method comes in several forms, including
          those that allow the specification of a particular bot, and the use of a <span
            class="literal">Responder</span> object to format input and output.</p>
        <p>For examples, see the classes provided in the <span class="literal"
          >org.aitools.programd.configurations</span> package.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.configurability">Enhanced Configurability</a>
        </h4>
        <p>The old <span class="literal">.properties</span> file has been replaced with several
          XML-formatted equivalents. Configuration is broken up among optional
          components&mdash;all configuration of the Core happens in <span class="literal"
          >conf/core.xml</span>, of the console in <span class="literal">conf/console.xml</span>,
          and so on.</p>
        <p>Each of these configuration files corresponds to a class which is automatically generated
          using a simple (included) XSLT file. (The classes only need to be regenerated when the
          semantics of the properties are changed.) The generated class includes getter and setter
          methods for every property, so a Core object can be configured completely programmatically
          as well:</p>
        <pre class="code"
        >
core.setRootDirectory("/usr/local/ProgramD/4.5-test");
core.setPredicateEmptyDefault("unknown");
<span class="comment">// ...etc.</span>
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.xml-parsing">Vastly Improved XML Parsing</a>
        </h4>
        <p>The "homegrown" XML parser included in previous releases has been replaced with a
          combination of SAX2 and DOM parsers now included as standard with the Java SDK. The
          results are very satisfactory. Not only is the new parsing performance at least as good as
          the old homemade stuff, but we now have built-in well-formedness checking <i>and</i>
          schema validation (see next note). The standard XML parsing technology is used in all
          aspects of the program where it applies: reading in AIML, parsing AIML templates at
          runtime, parsing bot configuration files, and parsing HTML templates (if used).</p>
        <p>Additionally, the XML parsers in use have been configured to be namespace aware, which
          moves us farther in the direction of being a highly interoperable platform. For instance,
          any embedded HTML or XHTML must now be properly notated as to its namespace; this enables
          Responders and other tools to easily filter out (or not) markup belonging to one or
          another namespace, and to do it in an intelligent, configurable way, rather than relying
          on ad hoc heuristics that keep specific "knowledge" of HTML or some other format embedded
          in the engine.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.schema-validation">Schema-Based Validation</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Program D now ships with a W3C XML Schema for AIML (also available at <a
            href="http://aitools.org/aiml/schema/AIML.xsd"
          >http://aitools.org/aiml/schema/AIML.xsd</a>). As AIML files are read in by the program,
          they are validated against this schema. Any errors are reported to the console and log
          files. As long as an error is not fatal, the remainder of the AIML continues to load.</p>
        <p>Please note that this release includes a simple shell script (in the <span
            class="literal">resources</span> subdirectory) that cleans up the "AAA" AIML set,
          including various idiosyncratic errors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.logging">Revised Logging Scheme</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Program D now uses the Java logging API to write information to log files and to the
          console. This provides for easier customization, and opens the door to cleaner integration
          with logging in larger systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.xml-templates">XML Templating for Responders</a>
        </h4>
        <p>The templates used by XML-oriented responders, like the HTMLResponder, now have a
          bonafide XML template language of their own. This template language includes a couple of
          new elements, <span class="literal">logged-in</span> and <span class="literal"
          >not-logged-in</span>, which can be used to provide conditional output depending on the
          user's login status.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.regex-substitutions">Regular Expressions for Substitutions</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Substitutions (for <span class="literal">input</span>, <span class="literal"
          >gender</span>, <span class="literal">person</span> and <span class="literal"
          >person2</span>) are now specified as regular expressions. This lends a great deal more
          power and precision to the input normalization step, and to the <span class="literal"
          >gender</span>, <span class="literal">person</span> and <span class="literal"
          >person2</span> processors. For a guide to the regular expression syntax that is
          available, see the <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">JDK
            documentation</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.responder-refactoring">Improved Responder Architecture</a>
        </h4>
        <p>The Responder architecture, especially the class formerly known as "SmartResponder" (now
          totally rewritten and called <span class="literal"
          >ServletRequestTransactionEnvelope</span>) and the <span class="literal"
          >HTMLResponder</span>, has been completely overhauled, addressing a number of serious
          design problems in the original. I'm open to suggestions for further improvements, but at
          last it is possible to say that the authentication system (a) makes sense as coded, (b) is
          decoupled from input and output formatting, and (c) is reasonably reusable. A complete set
          of example files to support user authentication is include in <span class="literal"
          >templates/html</span>, and some important properties can be adjusted in <span
            class="literal">conf/html-responder.xml</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.graphmaster-unload">Graphmaster.unload()</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Eion Robb submitted a patch to 4.1.5 that fixed a fundamental problem with the <span
            class="literal">Graphmaster.unload()</span> method&mdash;namely, that it didn't
          work. His contribution has been incorporated into the current release.</p>
      </li>

          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.irc-listener-fixes">IRC Listener fixes</a>
        </h4>
        <p>A person known to me only as "Kevin W." submitted a patch for the IRC listener that did
          the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>allowed joining multiple channels</li>
          <li>recognises nick in any part of message</li>
          <li>delay implemented (the "delay" IRC listener property)</li>

        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.java-language">Type Safety and Other JDK-Supported Enhancements</a>
        </h4>
        <p>This new version of Program D makes very extensive use of the new features introduced by
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">JDK 5</a>. The generics framework is used
          throughout the code to achieve a very high level of type safety, with far less verbosity,
          and virtually no (expensive) casting. Typesafe enums have also been employed to great
          effect in quite a few places. The enhanced <span class="literal">for</span> loop, which in
          almost all cases obviates the need for using an Iterator, has been employed everywhere
          possible. And in a couple of instances we make use of autoboxing/unboxing of primitive
          types.</p>
        <p>Incorporating all of these improvements has made the code easier to read, and therefore
          to debug and maintain. In quite a few cases, performance gains also seem to have been
          realized.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.coding-standards">Tighter Coding Standards</a>
        </h4>
        <p>This release also enforces tighter coding standards, including virtually all of those
          available from the compiler, including even the most "pedantic" conventions such as avoid
          unqualified access to instance variables. While some might argue that this makes the code
          bulkier, I would counter that Java is already bulky and wordy&mdash;this is just the
          nature of the beast&mdash;and it makes a lot of to take full advantage of the
          extensive compile-time checking that the platform can provide, in the interest of avoiding
          runtime errors. Why be half-hearted about it?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.error-checking">Better Error Checking</a>
        </h4>
        <p>As always, the quest to find even better techniques for capturing runtime
          exceptions/errors goes onward. This release has received a thorough going-over in that
          regard. Each time I've found a crash-producing situation, I've avoiding fixing the error
          until I've found a satisfactory way to trap it, and if at all possible, log it. This kind
          of progress is always good, although I do think that Program D was already pretty well
          along with the last release.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          <a id="v4.5.whatsnew.unknown-bug-fixes">Unknown Bug Fixes</a>
        </h4>
        <p>Numerous bugs that were never widely known or reported have been fixed. Going forward,
          all new bugs should be visible in the <a href="http://bugs.aitools.org">bug tracking
            system</a>, but there are no plans at the moment to retroactively publicly document all
          the problems that have already been found and corrected. Suffice it to say that the
          current codebase is significantly less error-prone, and more secure, than previous
          releases.</p>

        <li>
            <h4>Release Candidate 2</h4>
            <p>This one follows hot on the heels of rc1, and includes the following fixes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>AIML Schema bug</b>&mdash;The AIML Schema released with the previous
                version did not allow non-<span class="literal">li</span> content in <span class="literal">condition</span>
                elements; as a result, some valid AIML was rejected.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Bad default value for web-server conf</b>&mdash;The default value of
                the web server configuration file, specified in <span class="literal">core.xml</span>,
                named a non-existent file.  This would have caused confusion.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first one is pretty critical, which is why this release is so soon after rc1.</p>

    <h3>
      <a id="v4.5.requirements">Important Notes on System Requirements</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Program D requires <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">JDK 5</a>. See <a
        href="#v4.5.whatsnew.java-language">above</a> for the reasons why. The benefits available
      from this new release far outweigh the problem that JDK 5 is not yet available for all
      platforms. If you are a user of a platform that does not yet have JDK 5 support, you are
      strongly encouraged to get involved in hastening the day when it does.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The two included IM listeners fail to function, due to changes in protocols for the
          various services. Someone with knowledge of these services is invited to take a look and
          submit patches. The problems, which can be easily reproduced by enabling the listeners in
          the <span class="literal">bots.xml</span> file (and filling in some valid account
          information), are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>AIMListener: Loops with a "Error in main AIMListener loop." message (haven't tracked
              this down in the debugger yet as of rc1).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>ICQListener: Starts contacting the server, but never succeeds in logging in.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The issue of "merge policies", as for so long, has not yet been addressed. And does
          anyone care? Well, probably. But this author thinks that "merge policy" is just a small
          part of a much larger issue of knowledge base quality issues. Addressing these should be a
          project unto itself. Nonetheless, when there's a spare moment, we'll update the merge
          policy handling. Or feel free to <a href="mailto:programd@aitools.org">submit a patch</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The AIML schema includes embedded <a
            href="http://xml.ascc.net/resource/schematron/schematron.html" target="_blank"
            >Schematron</a> directives that fill in a validation gap that <a
            href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlschema-dev/2001Jun/0026.html">W3C XML
            Schemas cannot address</a>&mdash;namely, the three forms of <span class="literal"
          >condition</span>. A similar approach could probably take care of the other remaining gap
          of which I'm aware: the text part of mixed pattern expressions, which is currently not
          fully constrained by the schema. However, as of this writing, I haven't found how to
          process the Schematron directives as part of the loadtime validation process, so you still
          have the possibility of loading some limited forms of &quot;bad AIML&quot;. You
          may, of course, validate your AIML using any good modern XML tool, and it will be able to
          use the embedded Schematron directives. Coincidentally, the reprocessed AAA AIML set
          available on aitools.org does pass this additional test when validated manually.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Flash interface has not been tested. Since it has been updated to use an XML
          template, I doubt it will work with the old Flash interface from Chris Fahey, but it's
          worth a shot. If somebody with a copy of the Flash authoring tool (yow! that's expensive!)
          will get in touch with me, I would be glad to coordinate getting this interface working
          again.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The "readme" doc ("Getting Started with Program D") has been somewhat over-redacted,
          since quite a lot needed to be updated to reflect changes in property names, etc. Any help
          in this is greatly appreciated, or it will get back to its full glory sooner or later in
          any case.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I have a strong desire to include unit testing, but just haven't gotten to it yet. The
          included test cases do do a pretty good job of testing key AIML interpreter functionality,
          but of course it would be very desirable to have a complete testing framework that would
          cover all aspects of the application. Again, it's in the pipeline....</p>

      <a id="v4.1.5.whatsnew">What's New</a>
    </h3>
    <p> This release of Program D is significant for stability and important functionality
      improvements. Here is a list of highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Multiple Bot Support</h4>
        <p> Program D now supports an unlimited number of bots running from the same process. You
          configure the bots in the <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file. Different bots
          may share one or more AIML files, and memory usage is optimized to minimize duplication.
          Bots can be enabled or disabled easily by toggling an attribute in the <span
            class="literal">startup.xml</span> file. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> The example <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file has
          been moved to the <span class="literal">conf</span> directory, and is documented inline
          with XML comments. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Separable/Shareable Substitution, Splitter, Predicate Definitions</h4>
        <p> The <span class="literal">&lt;substitutions&gt;/*</span> elements (<span
            class="literal">&lt;input&gt;</span>, <span class="literal"
          >&lt;gender&gt;</span>, <span class="literal">&lt;person&gt;</span>, <span
            class="literal">&lt;person2&gt;</span>) as well as the <span class="literal"
          >&lt;predicates&gt;</span>, <span class="literal"
          >&lt;properties&gt;</span>, and <span class="literal"
          >&lt;sentence-splitters&gt;</span> elements of the <span class="literal"
          >startup.xml</span> file can each be assigned an <span class="literal">href</span>
          attribute pointing to a local file that contains the actual definitions. This allows
          multiple bots to share such definitions, or portions thereof, without needless
          duplication. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> The example <span class="literal">startup.xml</span> file
          illustrates this configuration. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Better Configuration of Listeners</h4>
        <p> Alice Chat Listeners are now configured in the <span class="literal">startup.xml</span>
          file, and each bot can be assigned its own listener. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> Because of recent changes to the ICQ protocol, the <span
            class="literal">AliceICQ</span> listener still does not function correctly (it connects
          and receives messages, but sent messages are never received). However, it is included in
          hope that a resourceful individual will be able to get it up to speed and contribute back
          to the community. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Database-based Logging Option</h4>
        <p> You can now choose to have all chats logged to a database. This facilitates a form of
          log viewing that is much more efficient and easier to work with than the XML approach in
          previous releases. A companion bundle of PHP files for viewing the log database will be
          released separately. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> You can enable database-based logging by setting <span
            class="literal">programd.logging.to-database.chat=true</span> in <span class="literal"
          >server.properties</span>. You must first create the chatlog table as per the <span
            class="literal">database/logtables.script</span> file. You also must configure your
          database settings properly in <span class="literal">server.properties</span>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>AIML Syntax Checking</h4>
        <p> Program D now does a better job checking some aspects of your AIML syntax when files are
          loaded. You will be alerted to malformed categories, invalid pattern expressions, and
          non-AIML elements in certain locations. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Simple GUI Console</h4>
        <p> A very primitive GUI-based console is available for bot interaction. (This was actually
          available in a previous release but not documented.) The console window will be a valuable
          tool for people building bots in non-English languages, because it can (or should) display
          all characters, not only ASCII/ISO-8859-1, correctly. The GUI provides menu commands for a
          couple of common shell commands, but otherwise no additional functionality. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> The console can be invoked with <span class="literal"
          >console.bat</span> (Windows) or <span class="literal">console.sh</span> (*nix). </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Artificial "Heart"</h4>
        <p> The bot now has a "heart", of sorts, that can issue regular pulses to let you know it's
          alive. At present the only implemented pulse is a text message to the console, but an
          interface has been provided so that you can easily add modules that update a database,
          send email, etc. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Response Timeout Control</h4>
        <p> You can set a maximum time allowed for trying to get a response. For some types of
          infinite loops, an arbitrary timeout is the only way to escape. This also provides a
          parameter for tuning scaleability of the server. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> Set the response timeout by editing/adding the <span
            class="literal">programd.response-timeout</span> property in <span class="literal"
          >server.properties</span>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Graphmaster "Node Height" Optimization</h4>
        <p> An optimization to the Graphmaster algorithm <a
            href="http://list.alicebot.org/pipermail/alicebot-developer/2002-March/000723.html"
            >suggested by Richard Wallace on the alicebot-developer list</a> has been implemented.
          This optimization is intended to reduce match times for patterns that include multiple
          consecutive wildcards. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Connect and Inactivity Strings</h4>
        <p> Now you can customize the strings used as custom inputs to the bot to signal a new
          connection or inactivity. Also, the connect string is sent to the console user session on
          starting up (or switching to a new bot) so that you don't have to type it. </p>
        <p class="additional-notes"> Customize these parameters in the <span class="literal"
          >server.properties</span> file. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Targeting Tool</h4>
        <p> The targeting tool is still very much a prototype, just a cleaned-up version of what was
          released in Program dB, but probably many miles/kilometers away from what it ought to be.
          However, in this version you can actually type in the target panel, which I'd managed to
          mess up previously. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <p> 4.1.5 is the last release that predates the Foundation's new <a
            href="http://alicebot.org/bugzilla">bug-tracking system</a>. Subsequent releases will
          make use of this system to enumerate bugs and their status. The following bug descriptions
          are more anecdotal than we'd like to provide in the future. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> A serious set of <em>thread synchronization</em> problems has been addressed and
              seems to have eliminated most or all deadlock and race conditions that were causing
                <em>sporadic, enormous delays</em> in some previous builds. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Some major problems with the <em>substituter</em> have been corrected. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The problems with <em>progressively deteriorating response times</em> seem to have
              been solved. Even under heavy load, a reasonably-equipped machine should see average
              response times in the &lt;40ms range, very often down to 1-2ms. We intend to
              publish some performance test results soon. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> The <em>pathname handling for learn operations</em> has been improved to work more
              "intuitively"--i.e., paths that are expressed relative to the files in which they are
              listed should work. </p>
          </li>
          <li> The <em>AliceIRC listener</em> correctly prepends a "#" to channel names when
            joining. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <a id="v4.1.5.requirements">Important Notes on System Requirements</a>
    </h3>
    <p> Program D 4.1.5 requires a JVM or JRE that is compatible with the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html" target="_blank">Java 2 Platform version
        1.4</a>. If you do not intend to modify the source code, you can download just the JRE (Java
      Runtime Edition), which is significantly smaller than the SDK (about 9MB as compared with
      ~40!).</p>
    <p> The current reason for the Java upgrade requirement is an internationalization-related issue
      that may not pertain to all users. If the upgrade is onerous for you, post to the <a
        href="http://list.alicebot.org/mailman/listinfo/alicebot-developer">alicebot-developer</a>
      mailing list for assistance with learning the necessary steps to build a version that will be
      compatible with JDK 1.3.</p>
    <h3>
      <a id="v4.1.5.openissues">Significant Open Issues</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> Many people have expressed the desirability of more cleanly separating Program D from
          Jetty in order to allow use of better-quality servlet containers (such as Tomcat,
          WebLogic, JRun, etc.). This isn't done yet but appears to be a trivial task. However,
          presently the significant integration of the bot server with a web server other than Jetty
          is more hypothetical than actual. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> The question of merge policies still hasn't been satisfactorily addressed. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> The program can still be flummoxed by malformed AIML. The decision to require Java SDK
          1.4 opens the way to using standard XML technologies now included with Java (previous
          linkages caused problems with the GNU GPL), but research is needed to measure the
          tradeoffs between improving this aspect and possible performance degradation. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Finally, the program is now at the stage where it could use a real overhaul in
          architecture. Several discussions are going on semi-independently about this subject. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <a id="v4.1.4">4.1.4</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Bug fixes and miscellany by Noel Bush.</p>
    <h3>Functional fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"secret.key" problem with DBMultiplexor fixed</li>
      <li>Important fix to sentence-splitting: problem with method was causing multiple consecutive
        punctuation marks to generate multiple "sentences", so an input like "hi!!!!!!!!!!" would
        get a long, long response.</li>
      <li>Fixed error in which values saved to database weren't being properly escaped.</li>
      <li>"targets directory not found" problem fixed.</li>
      <li>Problem in which some targets were not saved fixed.</li>
      <li>Target extension algorithm fixed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Functional improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented support of default predicate values, and return-name-when-set predicates.</li>
      <li>Configurable caching system now caches predicates in memory, writes out to disk or
        database only when necessary.</li>
      <li>IRC, ICQ and AIM listeners now work.</li>
      <li> Interactive shell has been extended to permit: <ul>
          <li>commanding listeners (currently AliceIRC is enabled this way by means of illustration)</li>
          <li>delete existing target data</li>
          <li>load new AIML files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>direct checking of some types of infinite loops</li>
      <li>XML chat log now has a "rollover" capability -- will not write more than a fixed number of
        entries to file before rolling it over.</li>
      <li>XML chat log viewing stylesheet looks in local directory for entity declaration resources,
        rather than to the W3C</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Code improvements, changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Somewhat better management of threads; inclusion of a shutdown hook from main Aliceserver
        in order to do cleanup before dying.</li>
      <li>Introduction of PredicateMaster -- removal of "StaticSelf" mess from Multiplexor, and
        somewhat more clarity about what a Multiplexor is all about.</li>
      <li>Moved Trace and MessagePrinter to util; devinfo and devfail methods will now print the
        name of the method that called them (not quite perfect but useful).</li>
      <li>AIMLReader works just a bit faster now, by recreating the StringBuffer after each new
        category is created.</li>
      <li>Dependence on third-party "LinkedList" and "LinkedListItr" has been eliminated.</li>
      <li>Now use "XMLResourceSpec" instead of my embarassing String array for calling XMLWriter.</li>
      <li>introduction of UserErrorException and DeveloperErrorException for the promotion of
        responsible coding ;-)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other notable changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript interpreter is no longer hard-linked -- could easily be replaced by a wrapper
        for another one.</li>
      <li>Hypersonic SQL code has been removed entirely.</li>
      <li>This marks the end of the effort to decouple Program D from GPL-incompatible code. We
        recognize that a tightly-linked combination of ALICE code with GPL-incompatible code is a
        contradiction of the terms of the GPL, and have striven to re-align the codebase with the
        spirit and terms of the GPL.</li>

          <li>formatting standardized, grammar fixed</li>
          <li>imports made explicit and cryptic variables renamed</li>
          <li>complete javadoc on nearly all classes &amp; variables</li>
        </ul>

      <li>less fixed dependence on non-GPL code (Jetty is removed to a jar file, no longer mixed in
        with org.alicebot code)</li>
      <li>some improvements to AIMLReader -- still not a "real" XML parser, but it's faster than
        anything else -- now there's less duplicated code</li>
      <li>similar comment for AIMLParser -- it also has "pluggable" processors</li>

    <p> Finally it's here -- the final reference version of Program D! Big thanks to Tom and Pedro,
      who have taken upon themselves the difficult task of bringing the reference implementation as
      close to the AIML 1.0 specification as possible. Their work has finished now -- the server is
      fully under the GPL, and you can safely use version 4.1.2 as a reference base for further
      development. If it's good, your work may even be incorporated into the next release!<br/>

      <a id="v4.1.0">4.1.0</a>
    </h2>
    <p> This is the 'reference' version Thomas Ringate and Pedro E. Colla have been working on. It
      is intermediate work in progress, with the goal to make Program D AIML 1.0 compliant.
      Currently, in version 4.1.0 ref, the support for AIML 1.0 is partial and achieved thru quick
      fixes. For the most part, AIML 0.9 is yet supported.</p>
    <p> Don't use this release as a base for further development, there will yet be major changes in
      the code. The next release 4.1.1 will hopefully adress the above issues within the next 2
      weeks.<br/> -Kim, Tom and Pedro</p>
    <ul>
      <li>change "localhost" legends to actual IP number.</li>
      <li>IO checking added when files are non-existent or empty</li>
      <li>std-bot.aiml must be loaded before any other AIML file if bot properties other than
        &lt;bot name="name"/&gt; are used on the pattern side.</li>
      <li>Fixed &lt;if&gt; handling (all parameters and &lt;else/&gt; should work
        correctly)</li>
      <li>Fixed &lt;condition&gt; - now supports all three forms</li>
      <li>&lt;sentence&gt; now spelled correctly, as well as other occurences of this typo</li>
      <li>&lt;that/&gt; returns uppercase.</li>
      <li>Fixed error when AIML file contains XML empty &lt;aiml .. /&gt; tag.</li>
      <li> Added AIML 1.0 compliant variable tags <ul>
          <li>&lt;get/&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;bot/&gt;</li>
          <li>&lt;set&gt;&lt;/set&gt;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>&lt;date/&gt;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Added partial support for indexed variables (return blanks when index out of bounds). The
        index may be ommited, in which case it defaults to "1". <ul>
          <li>&lt;input index="N"/&gt; N=1,2,3</li>

    <p> Now comes WITHOUT any AIML, you must install an aiml set manually and configure it in the
      SERVER.properties file (pointers are in the bots/readme.txt file), otherwise you will get a
      'FileNotFoundException'. You can get some AIML files (as well as the latest server release)

    <ul>
      <li>Finally, the release system in the CVS works (yipee!) -&gt; even small updates are
        easy to release -&gt; possibly regular updates</li>
      <li>Fixed buggy CVS entries that prevented .bat files from running smoothly</li>
      <li>Code cleanup (Mark Anacker)</li>
      <li>now the server.engine.startup property works</li>
      <li>Note - the server is not yet 1.0 compliant so the newest AIML files may not work, try
        using the 1.0.0 release</li>

    <h2>
      <a id="v4.0.1">4.0.1</a>

    <p> First release out of the CVS, included Jon Baer's AIML set.<br/> -Kim</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New run.bat to simplify startup</li>
      <li>Cleanup of source, unused libraries and miscellaneous files</li>
      <li>compiles 'out of the box'</li>
      <li>speech support moved to another branch (development stopped)</li>
