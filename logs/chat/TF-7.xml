  <reply>Hello! &lt;br xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/&gt; I will be asking you a series of questions about the EFQUEL homepage. Please answer as honestly as possible. Well here we go! <br xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> People have said to me that the News and Events Section is relevant.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> Do you share that point of view?</reply>
