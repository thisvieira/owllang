  <reply>Hello! &lt;br xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/&gt; I will be asking you a series of questions about the EFQUEL homepage. Please answer as honestly as possible. Well here we go! &lt;br xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> People have said to me that the Homepage of EFQUEL is a good source.&lt;br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/> Do you agree with that view?</reply>
